QUERY BREAKDOWN (follow these percentages):
- 25% basic simple queries (SELECT with sometimes ORDER BY or GROUP BY)
- 25% queries with JOINs and simple WHERE clauses (NO ORDER BY, NO GROUP BY)
- 15% queries with JOINs and complex WHERE clauses (sometimes ORDER BY or GROUP BY)
- 15% create operations (ADD DOCUMENT)
- 15% update operations (UPDATE documents)
- 5% delete operations (DELETE documents)

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
1. simple_query(bundle, fields, order_by, group_by) - Basic SELECT
2. join_simple(bundles, join_conditions, where) - JOIN with simple WHERE
3. join_complex(bundles, join_conditions, complex_where, order_by, group_by) - Complex JOINs
4. create_document(bundle, data) - ADD DOCUMENT
5. update_documents(bundle, where, updates) - UPDATE documents
6. delete_documents(bundle, where) - DELETE documents

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Follow the query breakdown percentages strictly
- For creates: You must provide a value for every field
- Vary your queries - use different bundles, fields, conditions
- For simple queries, sometimes add ORDER BY or GROUP BY
- For joins with complex WHERE, use multiple AND/OR conditions
- Think 3-8 seconds between actions
- Return JSON with action and params
- The primary key for every document is DocumentID, it's a string, and its automatically generated by the server.
- There can be no other primary Keys in SyndrDB, and DocumentID is immutable
